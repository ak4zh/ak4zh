### Hi there, I'm Akash (@ak4zh) Agarwal ðŸ‘‹

I'm a fullstack developer but that's more out of necessity. I come from a commerce background and relatively new to the world of web dev and programming in general, but I've taught myself programming and gained a lot of experience building software solutions for a variety of clients. I have contributed to open source projects and built several applications from scratch, which has helped me develop my skills.

### Freelance Work
I work as a full-time freelance software developer and have experience working with a wide range of clients and collaborators. I am committed to delivering high-quality solutions that meet my clients' needs and exceed their expectations. I have worked on projects ranging from small startups to large corporations.

### SaaS Apps
In addition to my freelance work, I have also launched a few profitable SaaS apps single-handedly. I am passionate about building products that solve real problems and provide value to customers. I have learned a great deal from these experiences and am always looking for new opportunities to innovate and grow.

### Hobbies and Interests
Aside from coding projects, I enjoy spending my time traveling, learning new languages, and exploring innovative solutions in various fields. As a software developer, I see myself as a problem solver who is committed to finding efficient and effective solutions to complex challenges.
